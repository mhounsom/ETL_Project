# ETL_Project

For our project we are looking at a couple different CSV data sources that pertain about MLS (Major League Soccer) player statistics and salary. The data we have found do not have the same start dates, so we will have to clean the data into a set number of years. With that we will be able to see if high salaries correlate to more goals, assists, minutes, etc. We can also see where players who were on a lower salary who may have had a fantastic season and then receive a significant pay bump for hte next season.
